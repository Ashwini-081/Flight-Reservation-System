Final Project Requirements

should have:
-> authentication: sign-up, sign-in, sign-out (with cookies/session/tokens)
-> roles: at least 2 roles (user and admin)
-> should implement spring security
-> should use database (should use relations)
-> production ready UI (UI should be well made)
-> tests should be written for business logic and custom database functions


bonus points for:
-> using micro-services architecture
-> using AOP


other things to consider:
-> best practices (naming, API, DRY, â€¦)
-> GIT (always push it to GitHub when a modular work is done and also push at EOD)
-> Try using concepts like inheritance, polymorphism, interface, collections, etc when necessary
